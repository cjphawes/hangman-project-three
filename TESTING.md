## Testing

The program was tested constantly throughout the development process. I had multiple users try out my game to spot bugs or grammatical mistakes which they found and I corrected.

#### Validators

I used the [Code Institute Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/#) to ensure sure the source code throughout was [PEP8](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) compliant.

No errors were found in all .py files.

## Compatibility Issues

- The heart emoji is a different size and color depending on the browser the user is using.
